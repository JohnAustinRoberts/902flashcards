What is the Registry?
  -a common storage area to store everything
  -to get there
    -enter regedit or regedt32
    -you'll have 5 root keys
      -HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT   
        -This contains everything on your computer
      -HKEY_CURRENT_USER 
        -Everything about current user
      -HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
        -Info about this computer
      -HKEY_Users
        -a list of all the accounts on the computer
      -HKEY_Current_CONFIG
        -Current setup of system
  -before editing the registry, make a backup by file > export
  -right click on the saved file and select merge to reintroduce the original settings

The Boot Process
  -winload.exe is the program that actually loads windows (it resides in This PC/Local Disk C:/Windows/System32)
  -but how do we get there?
    -the BIOS points to the active partition on the drive with the OS on it, determined by boot order
    -System Reserve Partition is the partition that holds the boot files
    -Bootmgr's job, find windload.exe
      -it does that using BCD (Boot Configuration Data)
        -this stores the information that points to the winload file
        -you can't easily look at this file, as it's not a text file, but you can use third party tools, like EZBCD to look at the file.
    -command line command bcdedit  will show you the same info as EZBCD, but in a text output format. (this is on the A+)
    -If you have a system with a small drive, you may not have a system reserve partition, everything will just be in one partition
    -If you're using UEFI, you'll need to load winload.efi inseat of .exe

Processes
  -Everything you do in windows is a process
  -There are two types of processes, applications and services
  -Applications vs services
    -Applicastions are things we see
    -Services are things we dont
      -these are long running programs. they run from boot to shutdown

Dealing with Processes
  -Task Manager
    -This is where you fix issues with processes
    -there are several ways to get there
      -lft ctrl + shift + esc
      -search task manager
      -ctrl+alt+del and select task manager
      -win+r taskmgr
    -Applications
      -lists open applications and their status
    -Processes
      -shows everything that's running right now
      -this is where you'll right-click and end task
  -Command Prompt
    -tasklist (Comptia calls it t-list, but that's wrong.)
      -this command in the cmd prompt will show all running processes and thie PID (Process Identifier)

Services
  -Critical to Windows
  -places to see these
    -Task Manager
    -Service Manager (services.msc)
      -this will show you all of the services you have and their statuses
      -here we can start the service/stop the service, a description, the status, and the startup type. We can also adjust properties of services here

Windows 8 task Manager
  -Task Manager improved with Windows 8
    -this assed the processes tab to give you a visual representation of your computer's performance
  -You can use resource manager to get even more granular details

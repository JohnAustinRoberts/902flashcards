RAM
  -Temporary Storage where programs run
 Types of RAM-
  DRAM (Dynamic RAM)
   -has been improved dramatically over 30 years
  4 types that have been used
    -SDRAM (Synchronous DRAM) 
      -Synchronized to system clock
      -168 Pin DIMM (Dual inline Memory Modules)
      -has 2 notches is bottom
      -Clock Speed meant RAM started getting Speed Ratings
    -Dual Data Rate SDRAM- DDR-SDRAM
      -184 Pin DIMM
      -Single notch
      -Takes motherboard speed, and doubles it. thus speeding up ram without speeding up motherboard
      -Take the mobo speed (100Mhz), double it, and that gives you stick speed (200 Mhz) then x8 = PC1600
    -DDR2 
      -240 Pin DIMM
      -single notch, in a different spot than DDR-SDRAM
      -Take mobo speed (100mhz), double it, (200MHz), double it again (400Mhz) then x8 = PC2 3200 
    -DDR3 
      -240 Pin DIMM
      -Single notch, again in a new spot.
      -Take mobo speed (100mhz), quadruple it, (400Mhz), double it (800Mhz) then x8 = PC3 6400

Ram Capacity
-When installing RAM, install them at the same capacity (i.e. 3 4gb sticks, not 2 4gb and one 2 gb.)
-Reference your mobo handbook, it'll tell you the biggest RAM your mobo can handle

Virtual Memory
  -Swap File
    -starts as an empty file
    -when RAM is full, the least used program is moved from RAM to the swap file
    -Usually done on minimized programs

    -large magnetic waves in places they shouldn't be
    -Hard drives store data magnetically, magnets can wipe a hard drive! (called degaussing)
  -ESD (Electrostatic Discharge)
    -can destroy the small circuits throughout your computer
    -Always unplug your computer before working on it!
      -touch the case or powersupply to ground yourself

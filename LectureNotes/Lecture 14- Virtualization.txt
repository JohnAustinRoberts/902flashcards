Virtualization Basics
  -when you have a computer virtually built inside another computer
  -emulation is different
    -this uses software to imitate hardware
    -Virtualization uses a system actual hardware
  -Virtualization saves power
    -can run multiple machines on one system, saving power
    -this also allows for consilidating hardware
  -System recovery is easy
    -each time you shut down the virtual machine, it is saved as a file on the host system
  -it's very handy for research
    -running a virtual machine can help you assist clients with different versions of OSs
  -Hypervisor
    -the program that runs and maintains the virtual machines
    -this comes with windows
    -two types of hypervisor
      -bare metal
        -runs on thumbdrive and boots computers
      -hosted on main computer

Your first virtual machine
  -Host Based Hypervisor
    -VMware
      -Usually not free
    -Microsoft
      -Usually included in windows
    -Oracle VirtualBox
      -free
      -create a virtual machine
        -set OS type
        -set hardware limits
        -you'll then need to install the OS
          -can be optical disc, iso, or any other normal boot media
        -snapshot
          -this creates a copy of the virtual system as it is
          -do this before any big changes
          
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
  -renting an infrastucture as a service
    -AWS is a good example of this
    -Setting up a web server on AWS!!!
      -go to ec2
        -launch an instance
          -pick free tier
            -windows server 2012 r2 base
            -set virtual hardware limit
            -configure security group
              -set to RDP (automatically) and set source to my IP so only my computer can access the server
              -add a rule
                -select http from anywhere
        -open remote desktop protocol and enter the ip address
          -this will connect you to the windows server running on your virtual machine where you can configure your website

Platform as a Service (PaaS)
  -takes care of full deployment of a website or web application
  -Heroku
    -open command prompt
      -go to folder containting site
      -install heroku toolbelt
      -enter command heroku create myappnamehere
        -creates heroku app and displays site name
      -git push heroku master
        -sends files up and starts site
      -heroku open
        -will open the web app
    -create a new app
      -upload the file
        -deploy
          -go to addons, add storage
    
Software as a Service (SaaS)
  -Does away with opticla media
  -Subscription based applications
    -Microsoft Office 365

Cloud Ownership
  -AWS is a public cloud
    -anyone can put data on this cloud
  -private clouds 
    -only you can access private cloud
  -community cloud  
    -only you and those you invite can access the community cloud
  -hybrid cloud
    -uses both public and private clouds, seperating data

  -system lockup
    -is it the application that caused it?
      -if it happens every time you do the same thing? then yes, it's the problem
    -reboot into safe mode, and uninstall the application
      -now run the computer for a while, if no more lockups, its the application
      -try to reinstall the application from another source
        -if problem continues to persist, it's a bad application, and the creator should be notified of the issue
    
Kernel Panics
  -these are on every OS. During lockups, if possible, the kernel panic wil throw an error on the screen, think blue screen of death
  -these include error codes you can research
  -new hardware can cause kernel panics
  -corrupted driver can cause kernel panics
  -usually occurs because of something that was just changed

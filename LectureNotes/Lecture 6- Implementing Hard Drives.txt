Understanding Partitioning-
  -Taking one physical drive and seperating it into multiple virtual chunks
  -Boot Partition
  -Recovery Partition
  -To do
    -Create the partition
    -Make it accessible to the file system by a process called Mounting
      -this assigns a letter value to the virtual drive
  All drives have at least one partition
  -Two types of Partitons
    -Master Boot Record (MBR)
      -Older
        -came out with first PCs
      -Boot loader
        -Located at LBA0 on the hard drive, tells system where to go to find OS (Active Partition)
      -Partition Table
        -broken into 4 pieces
        -Max of 4 primary partitions
      -Settings Table
        -Only OS can get to
      -Max partition size is limited to two terabytes
    -GUID Partition Table (GPT)
      -Much Newer
      -Protective MBR  
        -located at LBA0 on hard drive
        -If system only reads MBR, it will us that part
        -if not, it will skip over to the Primary GPT Header
      -Primary GPT Header
        -Boot Loader
      -Secondary GPT Header
        -backup of GPT

Basic Partitioning
  -MBR Partitioning
    -Max of 4 partitions of 2 TB
    -To create Single Partition
        -Go to disk management
        -find unallocated
        -New Simple Volume
            -Wizard sees max size
            -choose how much you'd like to use
            -Then assign a drive letter/folder name to mount it
            -Format the drive, typically using the default settings
            -Voila!
    -To Create Multiple Partitions
        -Go to disk management
        -find unallocated disk
        -right click and select New Simple Volume
          -Wizard shows max size
          -Choose about half
          -finish out wizard with defaults
          -when disk management shows again, you'll see the unallocated remainder
            -you can then repeat the above process to format the new partition
    -Extended Partition and logical volumes
      -Primary Partition is what most are called
      -when a 4th partition is created, it's created as a extended partition and logical drive
        -if the volume is deleted, it will leave the extended partition
        -You can create multiple logical drives in the extended partition, thus getting around the 4 partition limit of MBR
    -To delete Partitions
      -Right click on the partition and select Delete Volume
      -This is a permanent action, and will remove any data that was stored on that partition
  -(GUID Partition Table) GPT Partitioning
    -Globally Unique Identifier (GUID)
      -128 bit long string of numbers 
    -The hard drive will usually come showing as 2 drives for MBR cut off after 2 terabytes
      -right click and select Convert to GPT Disk
      -drive will show as one unallocated amount
      -repeat the same exact process as MBR to create the partition
      -Note though, that when you create your 4th partition, it doesn't create an extended partition with logical drives, it's just regular partitions

Dynamic Disks
  -Predate GPT, but after MBR
  -In windows Disk Manager
    -convert to Dynamic Disk
      -can make as many partitions that you want
      -Same process as basic to create simple volumes
      -Spanning
        -create a volume across multiple drives
        -choose new drive right click and New Spanned Volume
        -select the additional drives to span to
        -Set the size of the drive and format normally
        -this will convert the basic disks to dynamic
        -wahoo!
        -It's a little risky though, the second drive will not be written to until the first drive is full, and if either drive fails, the whole of the data is lost
          -RAID 0 is a much better setup
     -only way to convert back to basic is to delete all the volumes

File Systems
  -File Allocation Table (FAT) file System
    -oldest system
    -had a 1 to 1 list of each sector and what was stored there
    -Each sector stored 512 Bytes
      -65,536 Entries in each byte
    -only 32 Megabytes total could be processed
    -No File Permissions
      -nothing you could do to lock files between users 
  -Clusters are multiple sectors
    -once drives became large enough that a 1 to 1 was not possible, sectors are clustered together for addressing
  -FAT32
    -Uses 32-bit addressing
       -Up to 2tb partition
    -Max file size 4gb
    -Still popular on flash media
    -no file permissions
  -exFAT (aka FAT64)
    -Great for large flash memory
    -up to 128 Petabyte and File size!
  -Linux and Apple
    -ext3
      -older linux file system
      -32TB partitions
      -Unix-Style Permissions
    -ext4
      -linux fs
      -vastly improved ext3
        -improved performance and data security
      -1 Exabyte partitions
    -HFS+
      -Apple FS
      -8 EB partition size
      -Linux permissions
    -NTFS (New Technology File System)
      -Gold Standard of file system
      -Very detailed permissions 
      -very good data security
      -supports up to 256 TB partitions

Storage Spaces
  -Came out with Windows 8
    -works the same in 10
  -open disk management
  -open storage spaces
    -through control panel
  -create a pool (minimum of 1, up to alot of drives)
  -4 resliencies
    -1 simple (jbod) all one big disk
    -2 way mirror
      -min 2 drives
      -mirrored
    -3 way mirror
      -similar to raid 6
      -min 5 drives
      -can lose up to 2 drives and still recover
    -Parity 
      -basically raid 5
      -need 3 drives
  -Thin Provisioning
    -overstate the size of the drive to leave more room in the drive to add later drives
    -reports to everything that it is the larger value

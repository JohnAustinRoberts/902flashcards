Power Supplies
  -Never Skimp on a Power Supply
  -Efficiency
    -The amount of watts that is actually generated vs the amount rated
  -Rails
    -electrical circuityry that isolate different power outputs

Power Protection
  -Power Spikes
    -more than 120 volts AC
    -breaks stuff by overloading circuits
  -Power Sag/Brownout
    -less than 120 volts AC at peaks
    -turns stuff off, not breaking stuff
  -Surge Supressor
    -mitigate the amount of spikes/surges
    -Smooths spikes down to no more than 120 volts
    -things to look for
      -look for UL rated powerstrip sticker
      -reset button
      -look for something with rj11/dsl line connectors
      -to mitigate sags, (uninterupptable power supply) UPS should be used
        -basically a surge protector with a battery built in
